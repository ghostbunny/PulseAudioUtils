The correctness of working of the PulseAudioRecorder depends on the translation
of pactl in the specific language.

The strings
Source #
Name: 
Microphone of
Monitor of

have to be checked against the output of "pactl list"
If the output is not translated in your languages copy the 
English text into the translation or don't write anything
into the translation for this string.
